# Working-With-jQuery-Animations

This is my excursion into finding more about jQuery animations and maybe some other animations. 

Objectives: 
- integrate typescript and less
- explore options to auto-compile
- work with each type of jQuery animation to find out what it does
- (optional) work with other types of animations

Results: 
- Auto-Compile LESS "less-watch-compiler styles/less styles/css"
- Auto-Compile TypeScript "tsc *.ts --watch" in scripts folder
